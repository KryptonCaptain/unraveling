Unraveling of the Eldritch
==========================

This is a WIP Thaumcraft 4 addon.

The main themes are exploration, reverse engineering and unconventional ways to do stuff. Addon aims to create an atmosphere of fiddling with unknown, where the pieces of puzzle hint at some underlying complex structure. 

Some parts are loosely based on a Twilight Forest by Benimatic. 

Planned and somewhat implemented features:
* [WIP] Some shortcuts to TC4 early research grind
* [WIP] New dimension with new dungeon
* [WIP] Alternate resource generation
* [NYI] Thaumic ways to craft and improve some neat stuff from TF
