absolutely bare bones:

new dim
empty pyramid
>1 rooms with devices
research






    
        for (ArrayList<Item> itemArrayList : itemRegistry.values()) {
            for (Item item : itemArrayList) {
                registerRecipe((ITTinkererRegisterable) item);
            }
        }


        
if player discovered every aspect
then 
there is a chance to learn advanced stuff

need to refactor
class ResearchNoteData

get description(player)
get value
get type
get prerequisites
boolean can use(player)
perform_use
read from nbt

and so on

class ItemResearchNote

 getIconIndex for switching icons based on stack data.
 or maybe just metadata

You come upon an obelisk made from a type of stone you have never seen before.  Staring at it intently, the smooth surface suddenly changes to an inscription.  The inscription is a piece of a lost ancient map.  Quickly, you copy down the piece, and the inscription vanishes as abruptly as it had appeared."
 
 
A smooth stone on the face of this pillar begins to swirl as you approach. Looking into it, you are amazed to see answers to questions you have pondered for years.  The stone suddenly goes still, but you realize you have learned much."
"{Learning Stone}

You approach the pillar, hoping to gain more insight, but the stone now does nothing more than reflect the sunlight."
