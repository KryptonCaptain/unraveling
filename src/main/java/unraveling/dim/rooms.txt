Lich Dimension:
астероид 
в центре пирамида
и портал 

иногда там может быть:
руины деревни

странная пирамида https://www.reddit.com/r/Minecraft/comments/1f426w/a_funky_pyramid_i_made/
площадка с обелисками https://www.reddit.com/r/Minecraft/comments/ulvad/i_like_the_addition_of_pyramids_but_i_thought/?ref=search_posts


pyramid layout:
в центре лестница (а-ля Twilight)
вокруг лабиринт
входы на лестницу закрыты ключом 
 
 
 Ancient Stone
 не работает с Portable Hole?
 
верхний этаж - башня из Ancient Stone 
похожая на Twilight. Там будет сражение.
наружный слой пирамиды - возможно тоже Ancient Stone  
может быть нет, там есть дырки и Portable Hole работает 


== Room List ==

=== Special ===

Warded Stone at entrance

Entrance like in The Guide

Eldritch Portal near entrance

Central hallway with ladders
Windows out of Warded Glass
(?) Some of doors/walls are broken; crumbled. You can use Portable Hole on them
^^^ top two floors

Tower Room

=== Coridors ===

Mundane coridor

Trap corridors:
* Poison and liquid death traps!
* Golems in walls
* runic coridor



=== Rooms ===
Dye Room:
* Squids in aquarium 
* umbral rose 
* coal room: trees, some of them are withered. Leaves drop Coal Dust

Farms:
* Instead of spawners - wrath cages with essentia gather mechanism, as trap
  Everything through essentia mirror, but it's source is nowhere to be found
* Nether Wart / Wither Wart farm
  Strange plants (Ender Lily grower? Gold Ender Core? )
* Bees?
* Warded room for arena. Or farming? You will fight farmed mobs and golems
  Farm where hellhounds are like cows!
  
Research:
* Tables, bookshelfs, enchanting table, crystal clusters (sometimes balanced cluster)
* Brain in jar (think tank?), randomly placed alchemical construct
* obelisks, research table
* chest: books, knowledge fragments, lore fragments, Observations of immortal (?), crimson rites (?)

Potions and jars:
* Potions! Fumes!
* Brewing, unfinished
* Node in jar
* Empty jars, some of them are with fireflies or glowstone

Treasure
* like Twilight
* Thaumium and amber blocks storage
* Void metal cluster
* Trophy room
* Vis relays room (see Api.TileVisNode )

Utility:
* Room with giant bones growing
* Room with jars. Some with fireflies
* Room qith crystal clusters. And shards
* Void Metal Ore Transformation Room
There is room when you can convert iron ore to thaum ore
Or maybe into void ore if you supply it with something. It a bit more efficient than making void seeds

* The Darkness Generator uses regular wheat seeds to create Seeds of Darkness, which you need to create other Eldritch items.

In order to be able to work, the darkness generator needs to be placed close to an Eldritch Monolith, and it also needs to be sheltered from light - any light (even moonlight) hinders its operation. The secret treasure chambers below an Eldritch Monolith which you can unlock using the Eldritch Keystone: Tlhutlh each contain one monolith and are thus ideally suited for the placement of darkness generators. 



== Lab Block List ==

Deconstructor - Q thing
When you break lich devices, artifacts pour out. Or gears, or...
You can research them

Devices look like infuser from tc 2 (or tc 3?)
But have different runes on them

connected by random pipes
random magic mirrors

bone meal like redstone

Maybe something like horadric cube

Or antibuilder which can be turned off

Ender lily grower?

Each block has cradfting recipe but it's unavailable
Materials:
* Eldritch Gears 
* Useless staff scepters
* Nitor / Alumentum / Enchanted Fabric / amber / quicksilver
* block of thaumium / block of void (?)
* Focus
* soul sand
* machine frame?


Wand parts? ? Bingo with uncrafting - —- doesn't really work

Focus eraser?
Lich tries to craft some machine
Like a thermal expansion one
With staff scepter instead of reception coil

Unknown
block of thaumium
Staff, 2 thaumium gears?

Half crafted focus








Reverse engineering the scepters into foci



Some sort of reception coil
Like Redstone? You can place it

Render tricks: death animation, different models for different phases

Lich battle: there are several bone barrels
Or bone tree. It heals lich

Appearance
Some bone trees have no outward appearance betraying their status (the bones are around the roots, having sunk deep within the trunk). This is most often the case when a bone tree takes root in or near a populated or well-travelled area. Most however, have obvious bits of bone dangling from their boughs, or tangled in their roots. The most aged and profane bone trees seem to be sheathed in a bony coating, complete with many terrible skull-faces and bony hands and ribs. Bone trees that grow from the seed of a greater bone tree resemble the original tree but with a malignant, evil twist to the orignal form.

Well, you've got the right mindset for a lich to-be. Trying to compromise with that kind of ludicrous evil will help set you down the path of darkness.





    
Iron golems





Warded doors. Maybe in separate buildings? Lich drops key

Maze: could be a lair? Of lich?
