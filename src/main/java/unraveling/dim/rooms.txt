# need to change walls material.
# Ancient Stone gives off light; this is wrong for void production room
# also, ancient stone is too square.

== Demiplane ==
out of crusted stone?
place to have portal?
look at End generation?
obelisk / Eldritch Portal near entrance?

== Progression Considerations ==
Route 1
Central Staircase is closed; Lich has key
Ancient Stone is in Portable Hole blacklist 
Entrance is dangerous: so either Blink, invisibility or... some parts of outer hull are damaged, and you can Portahole here.
(?) Some of doors/walls are broken; crumbled. You can use Portable Hole on them
^^^ top two floors

Route 2
Nothing is closed.
You can go anywhere, portable hole is fair game. You can go to the boss. Cthulhu bless your soul

Warded doors are in separate buildings. Lich drops key

== Levels ==
Basement: entrance lead here. Walls are thick. Many traps here.
Middle: usual maze, central stairs.
Top:
Roof: tower out of Ancient Stone (?). Boss spawns in this room. Bone tree here. It heals lich and allows for skeleton summon

== Room List ==

=== Special ===

Warded Stone at entrance

Windows out of Warded Glass

Tower Room

Mundane coridor

=== Rooms ===
Dye Room:
* Squids in aquarium 
* umbral rose 
* coal room: trees, some of them are withered. Leaves drop Coal Dust

Farms:
* Instead of spawners - wrath cages with essentia gather mechanism, as trap
  Everything through essentia mirror, but it's source is nowhere to be found
* Nether Wart / Wither Wart farm
  Strange plants (Ender Lily grower? Gold Ender Core? )
* Bees?
* Warded room for arena. Or farming? You will fight farmed mobs and golems
  Farm where hellhounds are like cows!
  
Research:
* Tables, bookshelfs, enchanting table, crystal clusters (sometimes balanced cluster)
* Brain in jar (think tank?), randomly placed alchemical construct
* obelisks, research table
* chest: books, knowledge fragments, lore fragments, Observations of immortal (?), crimson rites (?)

Potions and jars:
* Potions! Fumes!
* Brewing, unfinished
* Node in jar

* chest in a small house, like in TF
* Thaumium and amber blocks storage
* Void metal cluster
* Trophy room
* Vis relays room (see Api.TileVisNode )

Utility:
* Room with giant bones growing
* Room with jars. Some with fireflies
* Room with crystal clusters. And shards
* Antibuilder
* Antiflight
* Void Production Room: it should be dark

== Lab Block List ==

Deconstructor - Q thing
When you break lich devices, artifacts pour out. Or gears, or...
You can research them

Devices look like infuser from tc 2 (or tc 3?)
But have different runes on them

connected by random pipes
random magic mirrors

bone meal like redstone

Maybe something like horadric cube


Each block has cradfting recipe but it's unavailable
Materials:
* Eldritch Gears 
* Useless staff scepters
* Nitor / Alumentum / Enchanted Fabric / amber / quicksilver
* block of thaumium / block of void (?)
* Focus
* soul sand

Wand parts? ? Bingo with uncrafting - —- doesn't really work

Focus eraser?
Lich tries to craft some machine
Like a thermal expansion one
With staff scepter instead of reception coil

    
7 arcane brick
6 arcane block

2DO: wall thickness, floor thickness
